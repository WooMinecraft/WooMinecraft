I will setup a minecraft website on my test wordpress and show people how a blogging software can be turned into a fully functional minecraft server site :)

A WooCommerce Minecraft Bridge
------------

This bridge was created out of both a necessity and a side-project of mine.  I, like other people, wanted a free and open sourced self-hosted solution for Minecraft donations.

Leveraging the power of a WordPress plugin, WooCommerce, and Bukkit's API, this amazing plugin was made.

Please Contribute
-------------

I encourage all of you to fork the repo and make pull requests to the development branch.  I would like this to become the best open source project minecraft donation system out there.

Let's make this the best plugin ever, I believe we can do it.

> All users who make a pull request will receive credit either on this README, or in the future wiki.  Which I'm working on almost weekly.

> Additionally there will be a CONRIBUTORS file which lists each and every contributor along with a url if they wish.  Simply add this in your pull request and it's done.
